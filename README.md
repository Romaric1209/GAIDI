# GAIDI
## GenAI_Data_Identifier

Goal: To recreate the Le Wagon project I was a part of, from scratch to bottom, with my pipeline, my models (No pre-trained models allowed) and do the deployment as well as the user interface, in order to master all aspects of a project from the beginning to the end.

The Wagon Project was to create an AI generated content detector. I rebuilt the models to detect image and text generated content. I deployed it locally with uvicorn, then I built a Dockerfile, wrapped it with streamlit and deployed it using Google services (artifact + run).
I would ideally improve it to detect "audio" as well.
