It **depends on your objective**. Here's a breakdown to help you decide between **binary classification** (real vs fake) and **multiclass classification** (real, Deepfakes, Face2Face, FaceSwap, NeuralTextures, etc.).\n","\n","---\n","\n","### ‚úÖ **Binary Classification (Real vs Fake)**\n","\n","**Pros:**\n","\n","* **Simpler model** and easier to train.\n","* **More data per class** (especially if dataset is imbalanced across manipulation methods).\n","* Works well if your **goal is just detection** of whether a video is fake.\n","\n","**Cons:**\n","\n","* You **lose information** about *how* it was faked.\n","* May be **less interpretable** in forensic or research contexts.\n","\n","**Recommended if:**\n","\n","* You‚Äôre focused on building a **robust detector**, regardless of the manipulation method.\n","* You have limited or unbalanced data per fake class.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### ‚úÖ **Multiclass Classification (Real, Deepfakes, FaceSwap, etc.)**\n","\n","**Pros:**\n","\n","* Provides **more granular insights** about the type of manipulation.\n","* Useful in forensic, academic, or investigative settings.\n","* A softmax output gives **probability distribution**, which can help flag ambiguous or unknown manipulations (e.g., 0.3 Deepfake, 0.3 FaceSwap, 0.4 other).\n","\n","**Cons:**\n","\n","* Needs **balanced and cleanly labeled data** across all manipulation types.\n","* If a fake video was created using a **method not in your training set**, the model may misclassify it with high confidence.\n","* Models may **confuse manipulation types** if they have similar artifacts.\n","\n","**Recommended if:**\n","\n","* You‚Äôre working in a **forensic context** or need to **analyze manipulation methods**.\n","* You have a **well-balanced dataset** across fake types (or can artificially balance it).\n","* You plan to extend the system to **open-set recognition** or **anomaly detection** later.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### üöß Hybrid Option: Binary + Softmax Confidence\n","\n","You could:\n","\n","1. Train a **binary classifier** (real vs fake).\n","2. Train a **secondary classifier** to **predict manipulation type**, *only on the fakes*.\n","3. Optionally, expose softmax probabilities as part of **confidence scoring** for human-in-the-loop review.\n","\n","This allows:\n","\n","* High accuracy on real vs fake.\n","* Flexibility in analysis (showing which type it's closest to).\n","* Safer handling of *unknown fakes*.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### üîç Real-World Considerations\n","\n","* Many real-world videos may be manipulated in **unknown or novel ways**.\n","* A softmax model trained on 4 fake classes might fail when presented with a **fifth** unseen type.\n","* Consider using **OOD (out-of-distribution) detection** techniques or **embedding-based methods** later if you want to generalize more robustly.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### üß† Summary\n","\n","| Objective                              | Recommendation
